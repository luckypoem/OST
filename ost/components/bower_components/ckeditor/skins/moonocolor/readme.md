"Moono Color" Skin
====================

Based on the offical skin of CKEditor "Moono".  All the icons have been changed using [FAMFAMFAM](http://www.famfamfam.com) icons and some that I created myself. 
This skin brings some color to your toolbar! :-)

For more information about skins, please check the [CKEditor Skin SDK](http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_4.x/Skin_SDK)
documentation.
